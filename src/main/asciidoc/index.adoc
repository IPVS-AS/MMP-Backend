= Introduction
MMP (Model Management Platform) is a RESTful service for managing and storing models.

= Overview

== HTTP verbs
MMP tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.
|===
| Verb | Usage
| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource
| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource
| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource, full updates only
| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

== HTTP status codes
MMP tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.
|===
| Status code | Usage
| `200 OK`
| Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used. In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource. In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.
| `201 Created`
| The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in a new resource being created.
| `204 No Content`
| The server has successfully processed the request but does not return any content.
| `400 Bad Request`
| The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).
| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.
